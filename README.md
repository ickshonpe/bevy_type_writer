# Bevy Typewriter

Console RPG style type writer text output for Bevy. 

Hacked this together really quickly. 
As is, it's really basic and inefficient but could be easily expanded to be more efficient
and support sound effects etc.

* version 0.2 supports Bevy 0.8
* version < 0.2 supports Bevy 0.7
